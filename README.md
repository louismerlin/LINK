## Installing
First, clone the repository on you computer.

Make sure you have Ruby installed on your machine, and just `gem install sinatra sinatra-contrib thin sequel` !

## Running
You can run in development by using `rackup` in the root directory. Run the test version with `rackup -E test`.

When developing, don't hesitate to use `rerun`. Install it with `gem install rerun`. Then just use it with `rerun 'rackup'` or `rerun 'rackup -E test'`.
